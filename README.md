## Description ðŸš®
this script is a simulation of a double pendulum system, which is a physical system composed of two pendulums attached to each other. The script utilizes the powershell console to create a graphical representation of the double pendulum system.

The script starts by setting the size of the simulation, and creating a blank screen of the specified size. Then, it uses a while loop to continuously update the position of the pendulum and draw it on the screen. The simulation is implemented using mathematical equations to calculate the angular position and velocity of the pendulum over time, taking into account the physical parameters such as the length of each pendulum, the mass of each pendulum, and the gravitational acceleration.

The angular position and velocity are calculated using the equations of motion for a double pendulum system, which are derived using the laws of physics. These equations take into account the interactions between the two pendulums, such as the gravitational forces acting on each pendulum, as well as the forces of tension and friction.

Once the angular position and velocity of the pendulum are calculated, the position of the pendulum is plotted on the screen using the Pixel and 2DLine functions. The Pixel function is used to plot individual points on the screen, while the 2DLine function is used to draw lines connecting these points, creating a graphical representation of the pendulum's motion.
